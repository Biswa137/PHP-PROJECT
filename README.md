# PHP-PROJECT 
convert any image extension(like .jpeg, .png, .gif) into .webp format for the web in PHP.
WebP is an image format employing both lossy and lossless compression. It is currently developed by Google. It's designed to use a more aggressive and better optimized compression algorithm than JPG and PNG with the objective of reducing file sizes with minimal quality loss. And that means faster websites consuming less bandwidth.
